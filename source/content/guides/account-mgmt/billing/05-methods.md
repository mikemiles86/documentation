You can set up payment methods that you use for all sites you own, or site-specific payment methods.

## Accepted Payment Methods

Sites purchased online through the Pantheon Site Dashboard accept credit card payments only. Pantheon does not currently accept alternative methods of payment for online site purchases (e.g., checks, PayPal, etc.).

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

Payment for a site can't be split among payment methods. This means that your payment can only come from one card at a time.

</Alert>

Personal payment methods can be used on all sites you own. Personal payment methods are managed via your [Personal Workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/account/workspace).
