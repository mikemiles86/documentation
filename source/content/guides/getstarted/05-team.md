To set up your team:

1. Select your gravatar in the upper left corner, then select **Create New Workspace**.

1. Enter the information, upload a logo (optional), and click **Continue**.

1. Enter the email addresses and select roles for team members that need access to this Workspace. To learn about roles, select **View Role Permission Levels**.

   Repeat this step for each team member you want to add.

You have created your first workspace, and added your team members. If you'd like to learn more about workspaces and teams, refer to [Workspaces, Sites, and Teams](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams).
