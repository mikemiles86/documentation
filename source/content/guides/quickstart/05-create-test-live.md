Now let's create our Test site and our Live site.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger">

If you haven’t completed the installation of your Dev site, return to [Create New Site](/guides/quickstart/create-new-site), and complete the installation before proceeding with the rest of this guide.

## Create Test Environment

1. Go to your [Site Dashboard[(/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/sites#site-dashboard)] and click the <Icon icon="equalizer" text="Test"/> tab. Here you’ll have access to your Test environment, though it hasn’t been created yet. 

1. Click **Initialize Test Environment** to create your Test environment.

  This takes a few moments.

1. Click <Icon icon="new-window-alt" text="Visit Test Site"/>. This will open your Test site in a new browser tab with the URL `test-YOURSITE.pantheonsite.io`.

## Create Live Environment

1. Go back to your Site Dashboard, and click the <Icon icon="cardio" text="Live"/> tab. Here you’ll have access to your Live environment, though it hasn’t been created yet.

1. Click **Initialize Live Environment** to create your Live environment.

1. Click **Workflows** (in the header area, on the right) when the environment is initialized. In the dropdown you’ll find your active workflow as well as the workflows we’ve completed to this point.

Congratulations! You now have three copies of your site running in three separate environments: Dev, Test, and Live.
